Breakout Session
exploring some modules
remember: help()
A. create and edit a new file called age.py
B. within age.py, import the datetime module
- use datetime.datetime() to create a variable representing when you were born
- use datetime.datetime.now() to create a variable representing now
- subtract the two, forming a new variable, which will be a datetime.timedelta()
object. Print that variable.
1. how many days have you been alive? How many hours?
2. What will be the date in 1000 days from now?
C. create and edit a new file called age1.py
when run from the command line with 1 argument, age1.py
should print out the date in days from now. If run with three
arguments print the time in days since then
BootCamp> ./age1.py 1000
date in 1000 days 2014-10-09 07:40:49.682973
BootCamp> ./age1.py 1980 1 8
days since then... 11699
